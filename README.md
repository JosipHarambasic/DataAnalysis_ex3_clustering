## How to run the code
Tip: If you have never used python before, or the following points could 
just as well be part of the intergalactic highway scheme of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, please 
Google "how to install requirements.txt in python tutorial" and 
pick the one most attractive to you. 


1. If you haven't install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
   or Conda https://anaconda.org/ (conda is up to your )
   
2. Open a Terminal on your machine and move to the directory of the code: 
   
    `cd /directory/of/this/code`
3. (Optional, but an indicator for good taste) Create a new virtual environment
   
    `python -m venv venv`
    
    Activate:
   
    Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   
    Else: `source venv/bin/activate`


4. Install the dependencies if you haven't before:
   
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Now you can always start your application directly with:
   `python -m bokeh serve --show dva_ex3_your_name.py`

6. Abort it with Ctrl + C
